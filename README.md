It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see. -- Thoreau
On the pier of San Francisco, coin-operated binoculars and telescopes stand waiting for visitors to peer through and "bring distant objects of interest within close range". We reimagined this scenario by asking ourselves what it would be like if the object the viewer saw was not the thing the telescope was pointed at.  
 


This project was proposed by Dave Rauchwerk, who makes software and hardware in Austin, Texas. Team members included Stephanie Lie, Jeremy Canfield, Rio Akasaka, Erik Heckman, Stephen Backer.
